# COMP150 Agile Essay
Essay on the Agile Philosophy

##Initial Proposal

A starting point for the research question that I intend to address is:

How can the use of [Personas](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/personas/) help game developers (identify the target market and) develop more effective user stories?

I intend to address this question by researching the ways that the use of Personas help developers develop products that consider their target market and how this feeds into the construction of effective user stories. I will link this to the games industry by exploring how Personas could be used to model the different types of players that the game is being targeted at, and exploring how this will help direct the game design, as well as the development and prioritisation of user stories.

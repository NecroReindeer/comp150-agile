# COMP150 Agile Essay
Essay on the Agile Philosophy

##Initial Proposal

A starting point for the research question that I intend to address is:

How can the use of [Personas](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/personas/) help game developers (identify the target market and) develop more effective user stories?

I intend to address this question by investigating the ways in which Personas help software developers construct a clearer picture of their target market and how this feeds into the construction of effective user stories. I will link this to the games industry by suggesting how Personas could be used to model the different types of players that the game is being targeted at, before exploring how this will help direct the design of the game, as well as the development and prioritisation of user stories. 
I will conduct research by looking at papers that explore Personas as an Agile practice, alongside papers that discuss the advantages of using Personas in general.
